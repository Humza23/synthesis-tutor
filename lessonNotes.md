Introduction to Columns:

Text: "In this lesson, we'll explore addition using base-ten blocks. On the right side of the screen, you'll find an interactive area to play with virtual base-ten blocks. Let's start by understanding the columns."
Ones Column:

Text: "Here is the Ones Column. It represents individual units or ones. You can use single blocks to represent numbers from 1 to 9."
Tens Column:

Text: "Moving to the Tens Column. This column uses rods to represent tens. Each rod is equivalent to 10 ones. Let's count by tens up to 90 using rods."
Hundreds Column:

Text: "Now, introducing the Hundreds Column. Flats are used here, and each flat represents 100 ones or 10 tens. Let's count by hundreds up to 900 using flats."
Combining Columns:

Text: "In the interactive area, you'll arrange blocks in columns to represent two-digit numbers. For example, 34 is represented as 3 rods (30) and 4 units (4)."
Example Addition:

Text: "Let's look at a simple addition example. We'll start with additions within each column. Pay attention to regrouping when the sum exceeds 9 in the ones column or 99 in the tens column."
Interactive Practice Prompt:

Text: "Now, let's put this into practice! Use the virtual base-ten blocks on the right to solve addition problems. Click 'Next' when you're ready to proceed."
